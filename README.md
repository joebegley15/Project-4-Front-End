This is a music review app. It will have three components. Best news songs, best new albums, and lists. What I'm hoping to do is have these featues inside of a database and then have them render on the front end. To start I'll use songs. If I can get songs working I can go from there.


POINTS OF CONFUSION
Right now I'm planning on using angular routes and factories. It seems like this is the best way to go. However, I don't know how if I need controllers for both the front and back end.
